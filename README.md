Lagan Fileselect Property Controller
====================================

Controller for the Lagan fileselect property. Lets the user select a file from a directory.  
To specify the directory and the filetypes to select, define the *extensions and *directory* property values. The *directory* property variable contains the path to the directory, relative to APP_PATH

A property type controller can contain a set, read, delete and options method. All methods are optional.

To be used with [Lagan](https://github.com/lutsen/lagan). Lagan lets you create flexible content objects with a simple class, and manage them with a web interface.
